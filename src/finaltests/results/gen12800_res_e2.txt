1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters.

1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light
from the darkness.

1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.

1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters,
and let it divide the waters from the waters.

1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament:
and it was so.

1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day.

1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together
unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is
in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after
his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after
his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.

1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days, and years: 1:15 And let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was
so.

1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day,
and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
upon the earth, 1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and
to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven.

1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind,
and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after
his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his
kind: and it was so.

1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after
his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over
every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them.

1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every
living thing that moveth upon the earth.

1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which
is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is
life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
them.

2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and
he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that
in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.

2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the
heavens, 2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,
and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not
caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the
ground.

2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
face of the ground.

2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.

2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he
put the man whom he had formed.

2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is
pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the
midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence
it was parted, and became into four heads.

2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the
whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; 2:12 And the gold of that
land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.

2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.

2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
Eden to dress it and to keep it.

2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat: 2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.

2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see
what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living
creature, that was the name thereof.

2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an
help meet for him.

2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
thereof; 2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made
he a woman, and brought her unto the man.

2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.

2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
ashamed.

3:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which
the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,
Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  3:2 And the woman said
unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:
3:3 But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden,
God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest
ye die.

3:4 And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 3:5
For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall
be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

3:6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that
it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto
her husband with her; and he did eat.

3:7 And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they
were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
aprons.

3:8 And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in
the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the
presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.

3:9 And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art
thou?  3:10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was
afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

3:11 And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten
of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?
3:12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she
gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

3:13 And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast
done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

3:14 And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done
this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the
field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life: 3:15 And I will put enmity between thee and the
woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head,
and thou shalt bruise his heel.

3:16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy
desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

3:17 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice
of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee,
saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake;
in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns
also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the
herb of the field; 3:19 In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,
till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

3:20 And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother
of all living.

3:21 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
skins, and clothed them.

3:22 And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to
know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also
of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the
LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground
from whence he was taken.

3:24 So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden
of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep
the way of the tree of life.

4:1 And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and
said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.

4:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

4:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.

4:4 And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.

4:6 And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy
countenance fallen?  4:7 If thou doest well, shalt thou not be
accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto
thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.

4:8 And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother,
and slew him.

4:9 And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he
said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  4:10 And he said, What
hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from
the ground.

4:11 And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand; 4:12 When thou
tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her
strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

1:5 And God called the light Day and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.

1:6 And God id, Let therebe a firmament in the midst of the water
and let it divide the water fromthe water.

1:7 And God made the firmamen and divide the waterwhich were
under the firmamen  fromthe water which wereabove the firmamen:
and it was .

1:8 And God called the firmamenHeaven. And the evening and the
morning were the seconday.

1:9 And God id, Let therebeunder the heavebe gathered together
unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was .

1:0 And God called the dry land Earth and the gathering together ofthe watercalled he Seasand God saw that it was good.

1: And God id, Let the earthring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed and the fruittree yielding fruitafterhis kind, whose seed is
in itself, upon the earth and it was .

1: And the earthrought forth grass, and herb yielding seedafter
his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after
his kindand God saw that it was good.

1:3 And the evening and the morning were the thirday.

1:1 And God id, Let therebe lights in the firmamenof the heave
to divide th day fromthe night and let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days, and years: 1:1 And let them be for lights in
the firmament of the heave to givelightupon the earth: and it was
.

1:6 And God made two great lights; the greaterlightto rule th day
and the lesserlightto rule the night: he made the stars al.

1:7 And God set them in the firmamenof the heave to givelight
upon the earth1:1 And to rule over the day and over the night, and
to divide the light fromthe darkness: and God saw that it was good.

1:9 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

1:0 And God id, Let therebebring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath lifs, and fowlthat may flyabovethe earth in the
open firmament of heave.

1: And God created great whales and every livingcreature that
moveth, which the water brought forth abundantly, aftertheir kind,
and every winged fowlafterhis kind: and God saw that it was good.

1: And God blesse the m, saying, Be fruitful and multiply and fillthe waterin the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth.

1:3 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

1: And God id, Let the earthring forth the livingcreature after

1:2 And God made the beast the earthafterhis kind and cattl
aftertheir kind, and every thingcreepethupon the earthafter
his kind: and God saw that it was good.

1:6 And God id, Let us make man in our image, afterour likeness:
and let them have dominion over the fish ofthe ea and over the fowl
of the air and over the cattl and over allthe earth and over
everycreeping thingcreepethupon the earth.

1:7 So God createdman in his own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them.

1: And God blessed them and God saidunto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply and replenishthe earth and subdue it and have dominion
over the fish ofthe ea and over the fowl of the air and overevery
livingthingthat movethupon the earth.

1:9 And God id, Behold, I have given youeveryherb bearing seed,
which is upon the face of allthe earth and everytree, in the which
i the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

1:30 And to everybeast the earth and to everyfowl of the air
and to everythingthat creepethupon the earth, wherein theres
life, I have given everygreenherb for meat and it was .

1:3 And God w everythingthat he had made, and, behold, it was
very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

1:1 Thus the heave and the earth were finished and all the host of
them.

1: And onthe eventh day God ended his workwhichhe had made; and
he rested onthe eventh day  fromall his workwhichhe had made.

1:3 And God blessed the eventh day and sanctified it: because that
in it he had rested  fromall his workwhichGod createdand made.

1:4 These are the generations of the heave and the earth when
they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the
heaves, 2: And everyplant of the fid before it was the earth
and everyherb of the fid before it grew: for the LORD God had not
caused it to rain upon the earthand therewas not a man to tillthe
ground.

1:6 But therewent up a mist from the earth and watered the whole
face of the ground.

1:7 the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostril the breath of life and man became a living
soul.

1:8 the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden and therehe
put the man whom he had formed.

1: And out of the groundmadethe LORD God to growevery tree that is
pleasant to the sight and good for food; the tree of life also in the
midst of the garde and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

1: And a river went out of Eden to water the garde and  fromthence
it was artes, and became into four head.

1:1 The name of the first is Pison: that is itwhichcompasseththe
whole land of Havilah, where theres gold; 2:1 And the gold of that
land is good: theres bdellium and the onyx ston.

1:3 And the name of the seconriver is Gihon: the same is it that
compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.

1: And the name of the thirriver is Hiddekel: that is itwhich
goeth towar the eat of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrate.

1:5 And the LORD God tookthe man and put him into the garde of
Eden to dress it and to keep it.

1:6 the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
garde thoumayest freely eat: 2:17 st of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shall noteat of it: for in the day that thou
eatest thereof thou shall surely di.

1:8 the LORD God said, It is not good thatthe man should be
alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

1: And out of the groundthe LORD God formed every beast of the
fiels, and everyfowl of the air and rought themunto Adam to see
what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living
creature, that was the name thereof.

1: And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air
and to every beastof the field; but for Adam there was not found an
help meet for him.

1:1 the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
slept and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
thereof; 2:2 And the rib, whichthe LORD God had taken fromman, made
he a woman, and rought herunto the man.

1:3 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.

1:4 Thereforshall a man leave his father and his mother and shall
cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh.

1: And they were both naked, the man and his wife and were not
ashamed.

1:1 Now the serpent was more subtil than any beastof the fieldwhich
the LORD God had made. And he saidunto the woman, Yea, hath God said,
Yshall not eat of every tree of the garde?  3: And the woman said
unto the erpent, We mayeat of the fruit of the treeof the garde:
3:3 st of the fruit of the treewhichis in the midst of the garde,
God hath said, Yshall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest
ye di.

1: And the erpent saidunto the woman, Yshall not surely die: 3:5
For God doth kno thatin the day ye eat thereof, then your eyesshall
be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

1: And whenthe woman sa thatthe tree was good for food and that
it was leasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one
wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat and gave alsounto 
her husband with her and he did eat.

1: And the eyes of them both were opened, and they kne that they
were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves
aprons.

1: And they hear the  voice of the LORD God walkingin the garde in
the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves  fromthe
presence of the LORD God amongstthe treeof the garde.

1: And the LORD God called unto Adam, and saidunto  him, Where art
thou?  3:1 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garde and I was
afraid, because I was naked and I hid myself.

1: And he said, Who told thethat thouwast naked? Hast thou eatenof the tree, whereof I commanded thethat thoushouldest not eat?
3:1 And the man said, The woman whom  thougavest to be with me, she
gave meof the tree and did eat.

1:3 the LORD God saidunto the woman, What is this that thouhast
done And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and did eat.

1: And the LORD God saidunto  the serpent, Bcause thouhast done
this,  thouart cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the
field; upon thy bellyshalt  thougo and dust shalt  thoueat all the
days of thy life: 3:1 And I will put enmity between thee and the
woman and between thy seed and her seed; itshall bruise thy head
and thou shall bruise his heel.

1:6 Unto the womanhe said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
thy conception; in sorrow thou shall bring forth children and thy
desire shall be to thy husband and he shallrule over the.

1:1 And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened nto the voice
of thy wife and hast eatenof the tree, of whichI commanded thee,
saying, Thou shall not eat of it: cursed is the groundfor thy sake;
in sorrowshalt  thoueat of it all th days of thy life; 3:18 Thorns
also and thistlesshall it bring forth to thee; and thou shall eat the
herb of the fid; 3:19 In the sweat of thy faceshalt  thoueat bread,
till thoureturn nto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
dust  thouart and unto dust shalt  thoureturn.

1: And Adam called his wife's name Eve; bcause she was the mother
of all living.

1:1 Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of
skins, and clothe the m.

1: And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to
know good and evil and now, lest he put forth his hand and take alsoof the tree of life and eat and live for ever: 3:23 Therefore the
LORD God sent him forth  fromthegarde of Eden, to till the ground
 fromwhence he was taken.

1:4 So he drove out the man and he placed at theeat of the garde
of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword whichturned every way, to keep
the wayof the tree of life.

1: And Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceives, and bare Cain, and
said, I have gotten a man fromthe LORD.

1:2 And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of
sheep, but Cain was a tiller of theground.

1:3 And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the
fruit of the ground an offeringunto  the LORD.

1: And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of
the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his
offering: 4:5 But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect.
And Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell.

1: And the LORD saidunto  Cain, Why art  thouwroth and why is thy
countenance fallen?  4:7 If thoudoest well, shalt  thounot be
accepted and if thoudoest not well, sin lieth at the door. Andunto 
thee shall be his desire and thou shall rule over him.

1: And Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass, when
they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother
and slew him.

1:9 And the LORD saidunto  Cain, Where is Abel thy brother And he
said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?  4:10 Andhe said, What
hast  thoudone? the voice of thy brother's blood criethunto  me from
theground.

1:1 And now art  thoucursed  fromtheearth, which hath opened her
mouth to receive thy brother's blood  fromthy hand; 4:12 When thou
tillest the ground, it shallnot henceforth yield unto thee her
strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt  thoube the earth.
